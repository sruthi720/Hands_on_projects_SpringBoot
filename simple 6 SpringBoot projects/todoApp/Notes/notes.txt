dependencies->
1. WEB --since its is web application
2.JPA -- to persist data in database
3.mysql Driver -- to interact my application with mysql database
4.Lombok -- let you use annotations, thereby reduce the use of boilerplate code. Eg. using @getter ,@setter ,instead of using setter getter functions
5.thymeleaf- serverside template, for ui purposes

step4->
Class-inside the model package with @entity annotation is converted by the jpa as table in th database. Also, the variables  of classes are the columns of the table
@Entity,@id,@Generatedvalue ->check
@Data-lombok , used for getters and setters

step5->
create repository interface, extend with jpa repository which provides some predefined methods
* Whenever you have configured the DB with your appln.->
 repository can be class or interface that connect the application with a database. Allowing you to see, retrieve, update and delete the data--CRUD operations
* JPA repository tell that u have JPA configured and entity configured-- interact with DB i can give u some predefined methods create, delete,update and retrieve
 for that specify ->JPARepository interface, along with the entity name  for which you are using repository and type of  primarykey (id)
 ie.CRUD operations. are managed by JpaRepository
 * after running the application. on db -->   select * from `todo-app`.task;
